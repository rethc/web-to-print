# About

An important part of my degree at WelTec was the final year team project researching “web to print” solutions for an external client, Copy Express Ltd. The project went through the entire project process using RUP iterative software development process and other methodologies.

Throughout the project:

- We installed existing “web to print” demo solutions that met with the client’s specifications and in accordance to our project proposal.

- Thoroughly test each solution using a various of techniques including Black-Box testing, Use Case Testing, and User Acceptance Testing.

- Developed add-on software in C# and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for Xero integration.

This was a great learning experience as I was able to learn the processes involved in delivering an end result This project enabled me to put into practice many of the skills I have learnt in my degree.
