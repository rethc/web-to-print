# About

An important part of my degree at WelTec was the final year team project researching “web to print” solutions for an external client, Copy Express Ltd. The project methodology we used was Rational Unified Process. This iterative methodology was great for a research and testing focused project. It allowed us to work flexibly in consideration to the project’s constant changes, but also produce our findings to the client that was to scope and by the provided timeframes.

Throughout the project:

- We installed existing “web to print” demo solutions that met with the client’s specifications and in accordance to our project proposal. 

- Thoroughly test each solution using a various of techniques including Black-Box testing, Use Case Testing, and User Acceptance Testing. 

- Developed add-on software in C# and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for Xero integration.

This was a great learning experience as I was able to learn the processes involved in delivering an end result This project enabled me to put into practice many of the skills I have learnt in my degree.

Awarded an ‘A’ Grade.
