**Test Plan for Potential SaaS Solutions**

# 

## Test Risks / Issues

Each Solution is being tested by individual team members at different
locations; to try and minimize the risks a set of standard templates and
Use Case scenarios have been created to help ensure the testing is done
equally for each potential solution.

## Items to be Tested / Not Tested

Any Web to Print SaaS that are found to be of initial interest to Copy
Express and that initially appear to meet their pricing and functional
requirements. Testing is not required on solutions that are obviously
too expensive.

## Test Approach(s)

1.  Open the Web to Print Use Case Priority Ranking template and the
    Potential Solution Evaluation Results (ensure they are the latest
    version). Save a copy of the Potential Solution Evaluation Results
    specific for the solution being tested.

2.  Work through all of the possible Use cases in the Use Case Priority
    Ranking and record the score results ((2 Fully satisfy,1 Partially
    Satisfy, 0 not satisfy) in the Evaluation Results document, write
    comments where applicable. If you can’t assess a use case then
    comment on this, if you are able to then email the supplier and ask.

3.  Multiply the Raw score with the Ranking to get the Extended score,
    add the extended scores to get a total. NB. If all of the use cases
    were not able to be tested then give an adjusted score as well as
    the score gained (e.g. 80% of requirements able to be tested).

4.  Open the General Requirements Criteria template, enter the name of
    your Potential solution and enter the scores for each general
    requirement.

5.  Multiple the Raw Score by the Weight to produce the Extended Score,
    sum these up in the bottom of the column. NB, this template is
    designed to compare three solutions so should be saved
    appropriately.

6.  Open the Master Proposed Requirements and Functionality document
    (this was taken directly from the Client Proposal); this document
    lists Copy Express’s initial requirements and may highlight any
    strengths and weaknesses missed by the previous two documents. Add a
    Green tick or Red cross by each requirement (and a short comment if
    necessary) to indicate there compliance within the solution being
    tested.

## Test Pass / Fail Criteria

## Each test suite will be assessed as a whole and used as a comparison to recommend the best possible solution to Copy Express Ltd; there is no Pass /Fail as such.

## Test Entry / Exit Criteria

## Testing will be exited when Copy Express indicates that they do not wish to continue with that particular SaaS Solution.

## Test Deliverables

## Each SaaS Solution should have a minimum of the three templates filled out and delivered to Copy Express at a Client Meeting; unless they have previously indicated that they do not want further testing.

## Test Suspension / Resumption Criteria

## If Copy Express indicates that they do not want further testing at this point of time then testing may be suspended also if the tester in waiting for the provider to update/provide demo links or improve site access. Resumption may occur if Copy Express requests it or the provider completes the updates etc. 

## Test Environmental / Staffing / Training Needs

> Each tester has access to the internet on their personal computers in
> their homes or those provided on the WelTec Campus.
