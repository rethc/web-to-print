<td><p><strong>Work completed this reporting period:</strong></p>
<p>The team started off this phase by developing a full description of each and every</p>
<p>Use Case so that all the stakeholders can understand them easily. They then prioritized the Use Cases (Ranking) based on the requirements gathered earlier. New Use cases were identified and added at this point and the event tables were updated. A general requirements matrix was also developed at this time.</p>
<p>The next major task the team carried out was research, investigate and summarize all the possible web solutions. The team prepared a comparison matrix of possible web solutions which closely meet the requirements and presented to the client (Copy Express).</p>
<p>The team was asked to further analyze the web solutions and present 3 best website solutions. A lot of reading, research, webinar, testing of trial websites and watching demos and discussion among team members took place.</p>
<p>All the team members put in great effort to prepare and present a solution to the client.</p>

<td><p><strong>Work to complete next reporting period:</strong></p>
<p>The next presentation will include the first three proposed solutions with some improvements, changes and further solutions requested by client. It will also include the analysis and reporting of 2 to 3 new web solutions; each will be reported using templates used in this iteration.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>What’s going well and why:</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of Functional requirements using Use Cases and General requirements produced easy to use templates that we can reuse in the next iteration.</p>
<p>Each team member has a better understanding of the Clients requirements and of how the web solutions operate and what is available, allowing for a faster analysis of future sites.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>What’s not going well and why:</strong></p>
<p>A few use cases need adjustment to better cover Copy Expresses requirements; change control is being used to address this process.</p>
<p>Not being familiar with the print industry we have undergone a steep learning curve, we have learnt that we need to be proactive in requesting feedback from sites based around the world; as we are students rather than Copy Express employees this has not always been an easy hurdle to overcome;</p>
<p>We felt we had not covered enough sites to truly be able to recommend anyone problem, this was mentioned to the Client who agreed that he would like to see more.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Suggestions/Issues:</strong></p>
<p>We need to take on a consultancy approach and have been given permission to use Copy Express’s name when required.</p>
<p>We need to adjust the project plan to reflect the work to be completed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><h4 id="project-changes">Project changes</h4>
<p>Use Case #33 and 34 will be amended if approved by the Client; they will be renamed as 33a and 34a.</p>
<p>On the outset of this iteration we expected that we would have to look for more solutions in the second iteration, this has progressed as expected.</p></td>
